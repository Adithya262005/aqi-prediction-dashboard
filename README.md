# 🌿 AQI Prediction Dashboard

An interactive machine learning-powered AQI Prediction Dashboard built using **Streamlit**, **scikit-learn**, and **Plotly**, trained on pollutant data from Kerala’s **Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Stations (CAAQMS)**.

## 📌 About the Project

Air pollution poses a significant threat to public health and ecosystems worldwide. Governments use the **Air Quality Index (AQI)** to communicate air quality levels and potential health effects to the public.

This project aims to predict AQI values based on pollutant concentrations recorded in Kerala, India. The pollutants monitored include:

- PM2.5  
- PM10  
- Carbon Monoxide (CO)  
- Ozone (O₃)  
- Nitric Oxide (NO)  
- Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂)  
- Nitrogen Oxides (NOx)  
- Ammonia (NH₃)  
- Sulphur Dioxide (SO₂)

Using a trained **Random Forest Regressor model**, the application estimates the AQI based on these pollutant levels, categorizes air quality, and displays an interactive analog gauge visualization.
